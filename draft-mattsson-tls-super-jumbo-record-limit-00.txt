            Super Jumbo Record Size Limit Extension for TLS
             draft-mattsson-tls-super-jumbo-record-limit-00

Abstract

   An extension "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" to Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) is defined that allows endpoints to negotiate a 2^16
   bytes maximum size of protected records.  This is larger than the
   default limit of around 2^14 bytes.

1.  Introduction

   The records in all version of TLS records has an uint16 length field
   that could theoretically allow records 65536 octets in size.  TLS
   does however have a lower protocol-defined limit for maximum
   plaintext record size.  For TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], that limit is 2^14 =
   16384 octets.  TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] uses a limit of 2^14 + 1 = 16385
   octets.  In addition, TLS 1.2 allow expansion from compression and
   protection up to 2048 octets (though typically this expansion is only
   16 octets).  TLS 1.3 reduces the allowance for expansion to 256
   octets.

   The "record_size_limit" extension [RFC8449] enables endpoints to
   negotiate a lower limit for the maximum plaintext record size, but
   does not allow endpoints to increase the limits enforced by TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446], TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13], and
   DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347].

   In some use cases such as DTLS over SCTP [RFC6083] the 2^14 bytes
   limit is a severe limitation.  DTLS over SCTP is for example used in
   3GPP networks to provide end-to-end-protection.  Some SCTP messages
   are already exceeding 16 kB and this problem is expected to grow over
   time as messages get bigger.

   This document defines a "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" extension
   (Section 3).  The extension allows endpoints to negotiate a 2^16
   bytes maximum size of protected records, which is larger than the
   default limit of 2^14 bytes.  This extension is valid in all versions
   of TLS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" Extension

   The "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" extension does not have any
   ExtensionData.  When the "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" extension is
   negotiated, an endpoint MUST be prepared to accept protected records
   with ciphertexts of length 2^16 bytes and protected record with
   plaintext of length 2^16 - the allowed expansion.  The maximum length
   of a protected record plaintext is therefore 2^16 - 2^11 = 63488
   octets in TLS 1.2 and 2^16 - 2^8 = 65280 octets in TLS 1.3.
   Unprotected messages are still subject to the lower limit.

   The "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" extension MUST NOT be negotiated
   together with the "record_size_limit" extension or the
   "max_fragment_length" extension.  A client MUST treat receipt of
   "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" together with "record_size_limit" or
   "max_fragment_length" and "record_size_limit" as a fatal error, and
   it SHOULD generate an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   In TLS 1.3, the server sends the "super_jumbo_record_size_limit"
   extension in the EncryptedExtensions message.

   During renegotiation or resumption, the record size limit is
   renegotiated.  Records are subject to the limits that were set in the
   handshake that produces the keys that are used to protect those
   records.  This admits the possibility that the extension might not be
   negotiated when a connection is renegotiated or resumed.

   For DTLS 1.3[I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] or DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] over UDP or
   DCCP, the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) also limits the size
   of records.  The record size limit does not affect PMTU discovery and
   SHOULD be set independently.  The record size limit is fixed during
   the handshake and so should be set based on constraints at the
   endpoint and not based on the current network environment.  In
   comparison, the PMTU is determined by the network path and can change
   dynamically over time.  See PMTU [RFC8201] and Section 4.1 of DTLS
   1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] for more detail on PMTU discovery.  For
   DTLS over TCP or SCTP, which automatically fragment and reassemble
   datagrams, there is no PMTU limitation.

4.  AEAD Limits

   The maximum record size limit is an input to the AEAD limits
   calculations in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].
   Increasing the maximum record size to 2^16 bytes while keeping the
   same confidentiality and integrity advantage therefore requires lower
   AEAD limits.  When the "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" has been
   negotiated, existing AEAD limits shall be decreased by a factor of 4.
   For example, when AES-CGM is used in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] with a 64 kB
   record limit, only 2^22.5 records (about 6 million) may be encrypted
   on a given connection.

5.  Security Considerations

   Large record sizes might require more memory allocation for senders
   and receivers.  Large record sizes also means that more processing is
   done before verification of non-authentic records fails.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" extension
   in the "TLS ExtensionType Values" registry established in [RFC5246].
   The "super_jumbo_record_size_limit" extension has been assigned a
   code point of TBD.  The IANA registry [RFC8447] [[will list|lists]]
   this extension as "Recommended" (i.e., "Y") and indicates that it may
   appear in the ClientHello (CH) or EncryptedExtensions (EE) messages
   in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].
